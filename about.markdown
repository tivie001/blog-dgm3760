# Hello, my name is Tyler Ivie, Tivie for short.

**ABOUT ME**
* I love sports: golf, tennis, basketball, love them all!
* Family of 3, 2 sisters, smack dab in the middle.
* I work at for Web Development Services at UVU as a Web Programmer.
* My favorite part is being able to create apps from scratch and to use them to solve real world software struggles.
* I hope to polish my understanding about JS and how I can implement in full-stack development.
