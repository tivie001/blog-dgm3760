    * Cleaned up some styles, and changed header image.
    * Added quick add recipe and list functionality to the main dashboard
    * Fixed bugs where filter was working.
   
#### What do you plan on doing next week?
 
* Test, test, test! Ensure app is working as it should be.
* Fix weird styling bugs.
* Cleanup code.

#### What roadblocks did you encounter and what did you do to overcome them?

* I didn't run into huge roadblocks this week. It was mainly just my own stupid bugs that I created.
