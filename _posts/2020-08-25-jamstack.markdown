# Hello, my name is Tyler Ivie, Tivie for short.
**What is the JAMStack?**
* A JAMStack is a site that pre-renders all the files for you using JavaScript and don't necessarily depend on a web server to run. Most of these sites are built custom-made, NextJS, or what I used: Jekyll to get the work done.
**Why is it an important tool in web development?**
* Faster development
* Better and higher security
* Better performance because files are pre-rendered
**How can a web developer use the JAMStack?**
* In about everything they do regarding web apps.
**What tools did you use to bring up your blog?**
* I used Jekyll to render my blog sites.
* I also used Netlify to host it.
**Why did you choose those tools?**
* I used **Jekyll** because it was easy to develop and follow the documentation.
* The integration with **Netlify** made it a lot more smooth as well to go live with the site.
* It also allowed me to get familiar with the technology, implement a new theme, and modularize it in order to make posting easier and more-efficient.
