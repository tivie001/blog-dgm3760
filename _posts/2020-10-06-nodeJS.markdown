### What is Node JS?
Before these assignments/lectures I thought Node JS was just strictly "server-side JavaScript". Which it is,
but I learned that in a more general sense, Node JS is simply JavaScript outside the browser.

### When do you use Node?
You can use Node for many things, but a few I learned were:
- Serving static web files from a folder to a static web server
    - So, HTML, JS, CSS, images, etc. can be served from a server using NodeJS and ExpressJS
- Serving API data
    - Connect to an API and render JSON data to a webpage using NodeJS
- You can render data from a database to a webpage using NodeJS
- Or you basically just creating any backend application requiring auth, database, and server side security NodeJs
is perfect for  

### What are some ways that Node differs from JS in the browser?
- First and foremost what came to mind Node does not have access to the DOM nor to any of the object methods that can
manipulate the DOM
- You can control what version of Node you are running instead of being dependent on the version the browser gives you 
What is Express JS
- Is a NodeJS application framework that provides a set of features for web applications and API's on the server. Express
has made it easy to implement HTTP request to and from the backend and front end of applications I've built for the 
latest NodeJS projects.

### Why would a developer choose to use a Templating Engine? What Templating Engine did you choose and why?
1. It makes displaying data on the front end of your application easy and clean to use. 
2. When using Handlebars, I found it easy to compartmentalize each file into its own view and layout, so I'm not serving 
massive html files all at once. On top of it all, it makes it easier to render dynamic data-driven applications with the 
mustache syntax.
