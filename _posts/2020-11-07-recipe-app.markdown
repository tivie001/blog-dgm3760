## Recipe App

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### What have you done this week?

What I did this week: 
* I mocked up what the overall layout and design of my recipe will look like (see screenshots above).
* Hooked up frontend app to server (in Express & NodeJS) and that to the database (MongoDB).
* Implemented the following endpoints GET all recipes and POST recipes to create a new recipe and return it to the 
recipe list. 
* Lastly, implemented the feature where a user, after creating a new recipe, can click on it and view a bigger view of the recipe and
its details.

#### What do you plan on doing next week?
 
* Figure out how to save images to MongoDB and get the finalized relational structure of my database.
* Refine some styles on the recipe card view.
* Implement the shopping list functionality.

#### What roadblocks did you encounter and what did you do to overcome them?

* Saving images to MongoDB! I think I'm going to have go the Graph FS route.
* Also, structuring and saving arrays to MongoDB was a bit tricky but I got it to work how I wanted it eventually.

#### Also, for this first post, please include an intro to the post explaining what your project is and how it will work.

* I was looking around and decided I think the recipe app would be one of the most challenging, rewarding, & useful apps aligned with my hobbies!
  The recipe app will keep track of various recipes that you like to cook and eat. Users will be able to add their own recipes, including ingredients and directions. They will also be able to categorize recipes and rate them.

A user will be able to do the following: 
* Add new recipes
* Add & edit ingredients
* Add & edit directions
* Create shopping lists and add ingredients from recipes to the list
* View and check off items from said lists
* Add & edit categories for each recipe
* View recipe details
* Search recipes
* Add, edit ratings for a particular recipe
